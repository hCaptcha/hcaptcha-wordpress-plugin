Enables hCaptcha integration with WordPress.

## Description

**NOTE: This is a community-developed plugin. All integrations were submitted by developers like you. If you see an integration that doesn't work, or one that's missing, please open a pull request!**

Note that PRs should meet [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/). This is automatically enforced by CI.
