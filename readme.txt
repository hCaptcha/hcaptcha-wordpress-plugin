Enables hCaptcha.com integration with WordPress.

== Description ==

[hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) is a drop-in replacement for reCAPTCHA that puts user privacy first.

Need to keep out bots? hCaptcha protects privacy while offering better protection against spam and abuse. Help build a better web.

== How hCaptcha Works ==

The purpose of a CAPTCHA is to distinguish between people and machines via a challenge-response test, and thus increase the cost of spamming or otherwise abusing websites by keeping out bots.

To use this plugin, just install it and enter your sitekey and secret in the Settings -> hCaptcha menu after signing up on hCaptcha.com.

[hCaptcha Free](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) lets websites earn rewards while blocking bots and other forms of abuse when a user needs to prove their humanity.

[hCaptcha Pro](https://www.hcaptcha.com/pro) goes beyond the free hCaptcha service with advanced machine learning to reduce the challenge rate, delivering high security and low friction along with more features like UI customization.


== Installation ==

Sign up at [hCaptcha.com](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) to get your sitekey and secret, then:

1. Install hCaptcha either via the WordPress.org plugin repository (best) or by uploading the files to your server. ([Upload instructions](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/))
2. Activate the hCaptcha plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Enter your site key and secret in the Settings -> hCaptcha menu in WordPress
4. Enable desired Integrations

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the hCaptcha plugin? =

The hCaptcha plugin supports WordPress core and many plugins with forms automatically. You should select the supported forms on the hCaptcha plugin settings page.

For non-standard cases, you can use the `[hcaptcha]` shortcode provided by the plugin.

For example, we support Contact Forms 7 automatically. However, sometimes a theme can modify the form. In this case, you can manually add the `[cf7-hcaptcha]` shortcode to the CF7 form.

To make hCaptcha work, the shortcode must be inside the <form ...> ... </form> tag.

= You don't support plugin X. How can I get support for it added? =

[Open a PR on GitHub](https://github.com/hCaptcha/hcaptcha-wordpress-plugin): or just email the authors of plugin X. Adding hCaptcha support is typically quite a quick task for most plugins.

= Does the [hcaptcha] shortcode have arguments? =

The shortcode adds not only the hCaptcha div to the form, but also a nonce field. You can set your own nonce action and name. For this, use arguments in the shortcode:

`
[hcaptcha action="my_hcap_action" name="my_hcap_name"]
`

and in the verification:

`
$result = hcaptcha_request_verify( 'my_hcap_action', 'my_hcap_name' );
`

See also the section *"How to automatically verify an arbitrary form"*

= How to add hCaptcha to an arbitrary form =

First, add the hCaptcha snippet to the form.

If you create the form as an HTML block in the post content, just insert the shortcode `[hcaptcha]` inside it. It may look like this:

`
<form method="post">
	<input type="text" name="test_input">
	<input type="submit" value="Send">
    [hcaptcha]
</form>
`

If you create the form programmatically, insert the following statement inside it:

`
?>
<form method="post">
	<input type="text" name="test_input">
	<input type="submit" value="Send">
    <?php echo do_shortcode( '[hcaptcha]' ); ?>
</form>
<?php
`

Secondly, verify the result of hCaptcha challenge.

`
$result = hcaptcha_request_verify();

if ( 'success' !== $result ) {
    // Block processing of the form.
}
`

= How to automatically verify an arbitrary form =

Arbitrary user forms can be verified easily. Just add `auto="true"` or `auto="1"` to the shortcode:

`
[hcaptcha auto="true"]
`

and insert this shortcode into your form.

Auto-verification works with forms sent by POST on frontend only. Also, it works only with forms in the post content, but we have plans to extend the functionality.

= How to block hCaptcha on specific page? =

hCaptcha starts early, so you cannot use standard WP functions to determine the page. For instance, to block it on `my-account` page, add this code to your theme's `functions.php` file:

`
/**
* Filter hCaptcha activation flag.
*
* @param bool $activate Activate flag.
*
* @return bool
*/
function my_hcap_activate( $activate ) {
  $url = isset( $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] ) ?
  filter_var( wp_unslash( $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] ), FILTER_SANITIZE_FULL_SPECIAL_CHARS ) :
  '';

  if ( '/my-account/' === $url ) {
    return false;
  }

  return $activate;
}

add_filter( 'hcap_activate', 'my_hcap_activate' );
`

= How to show hCaptcha widget instantly? =

The plugin loads the hCaptcha script with a delay until user interaction: mouseenter, click, scroll or touch. This significantly improves Google Pagespeed Insights score.

To load the hCaptcha widget instantly, you can use the following filter:
`
/**
* Filters delay time for hCaptcha API script.
*
* Any negative value will prevent API script from loading at all,
* until user interaction: mouseenter, click, scroll or touch.
* This significantly improves Google Pagespeed Insights score.
*
* @param int $delay Number of milliseconds to delay hCaptcha API script.
*                   Any negative value means delay until user interaction.
*/
function my_hcap_delay_api( $delay ) {
  return 0;
}

add_filter( 'hcap_delay_api', 'my_hcap_delay_api' );
`

= How to set hCaptcha language programmatically? =

hCaptcha defaults to using the user's language as reported by the browser. However, on multilingual sites you can override this to set the hCaptcha language to match the current page language. For this, you can use the following filter:

`
/**
* Filters hCaptcha language.
*
* @param string $language Language.
*/
function my_hcap_language( $language ) {
  // Detect page language and return it.
  $page_language = 'some lang'; // Detection depends on the multilingual plugin used.

  return $page_language;
}

add_filter( 'hcap_language', 'my_hcap_language' );
`

= How to whitelist certain IPs =

You can use the following filter:

`
/**
 * Filter user IP to check if it is whitelisted.
 * For whitelisted IPs, hCaptcha will not be shown.
 *
 * @param bool   $whitelisted Whether IP is whitelisted.
 * @param string $ip          IP.
 *
 * @return bool
 */
function my_hcap_whitelist_ip( $whitelisted, $ip ) {

  // Whitelist local IPs.
  if ( false === $ip ) {
    return true;
  }

  // Whitelist some other IPs.
  if ( '1.1.1.1' === $ip ) {
    return true;
  }

  return $whitelisted;
}

add_filter( 'hcap_whitelist_ip', 'my_hcap_whitelist_ip', 10, 2 );
`

= Why isn't my WPForms Lite installation working? =

Please make sure you have removed the reCAPTCHA keys under WPForms > Settings > reCAPTCHA to avoid a conflict.

= Where can I get more information about hCaptcha? =

Please see our [website](https://hcaptcha.com/).

== Privacy Notices ==

hCaptcha is designed to comply with privacy laws in every country, including GDPR, LGPD, CCPA, and more.

With the default configuration, this plugin does not:

* track users by stealth;
* write any user personal data to the database;
* send any data to external servers;
* use cookies.

Once you activate this plugin, the hCaptcha-answering user's IP address and browser data may be sent to the hCaptcha service on pages where you have activated hCaptcha protection. However, hCaptcha is designed to minimize data used, process it very close to the user, and rapidly discard it after analysis.

For more details, please see the hCaptcha privacy policy at:

* [hCaptcha.com](https://hCaptcha.com/privacy)

=== Please note ===

**NOTE:** This is a community-developed plugin. Your PRs are welcome.

For feature requests and issue reports, please
[open a pull request](https://github.com/hCaptcha/hcaptcha-wordpress-plugin).

We also suggest emailing the authors of plugins you'd like to support hCaptcha: it will usually take them only an hour or two to add native support. This will simplify your use of hCaptcha, and is the best solution in the long run.

Some plugins listed have been superseded by native support, and are included only for legacy purposes.

You should always use native hCaptcha support if available for your plugin.
Please check with your plugin author if native support is not yet available.
